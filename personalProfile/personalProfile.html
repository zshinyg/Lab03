        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I was born on March 15th, 1964 in Scranto, PA. I am currently 
            the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin here in my hometown of 
            Scranton.  I was hired as the manager after being one of the best
            salesmen in the company, winning consecutive awards for best saleman. Some things I love comedy, my coffee mug and
            my job. I hate Toby more than anything in the world though. I was once on
            a tv show called "fundle bundle". My favorite quote is "That's what she
            said".
